# Objective: Compare the Dynamic Algorithm vs. the Exhaustive Optimization Algorithm
Description: Implement the two algorithms for a player trying to maximize his defense with a list of armors and a gold budget. Compare their time complexity and find out which one is more feasible and practical to use in real life.

To compile and run the program, execute the following command: make
